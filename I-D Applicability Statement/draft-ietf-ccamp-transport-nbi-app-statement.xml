<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network (OTN)
   and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically
   deployed based on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are
   often managed using proprietary interfaces to dedicated Element
   Management Systems (EMS), Network Management Systems (NMS) and
   increasingly Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers.</t>

<t>Support of packet connectivity services over transport network
   domains are critical for a wide range of applications and services,
   including data center and LAN interconnects, Internet service
   backhauling, mobile backhaul and enterprise Carrier Ethernet
   services. A clear goal of operators is to automate the setup of
   these connectivity services across multiple transport network
   domains, that may utilize different technologies.</t>

<t>A well-defined common open interface to each domain controller or a
   management system is required for network operators to control
   multi-vendor and multi-domain networks and also enable coordination
   and automation of service provisioning. This is facilitated by using
   standardized data models (e.g., YANG models), and an appropriate
   protocol (e.g., RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>).</t>

<t>This document examines the applicability of the YANG models being
   defined by IETF (Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling
   (TEAS) moreover, Common Control and Measurement Plane (CCAMP) WGs in
   particular) to support Optical Transport Networks (OTN) single and
   multi-domain scenarios.</t>

<section anchor="scope" title="The Scope of this Document">

<t>This document assumes a reference architecture, including
   interfaces, based on the Abstraction and Control of Traffic-
   Engineered Networks (ACTN), defined in <xref target="RFC8453"/>.</t>

<t>The focus of this document is on the interface between the Multi
   Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and a Provisioning Network
   Controller (PNC), controlling a transport network domain, called
   MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) in <xref target="RFC8453"/>.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that the same MPI analyzed in this document could
   be used between hierarchical MDSC controllers, as shown in Figure 4
   of <xref target="RFC8453"/>.</t>

<t>Detailed analysis of the interface between the Customer Network
   Controller (CNC) and the MDSC, called CNC-MDSC Interface (CMI) in
   <xref target="RFC8453"/>, as well as of the interface between service and network
   orchestrators are outside the scope of this document. However, when
   needed, this document describes some considerations and assumptions
   about the information which needs to be provided at these
   interfaces.</t>

<t>The list of the IETF YANG models which are applicable to the ACTN
   MPI can be found in <xref target="ACTN-YANG"/>.</t>

<t>The Functional Requirements for the transport API as described in
   the Optical Networking Foundation (ONF) document <xref target="ONF_TR-527"/> have
   been taken as input for defining the reference scenarios analyzed in
   this document.</t>

<t>The analysis provided in this document confirms that the IETF YANG
   models defined in <xref target="RFC8453"/>, <xref target="RFC8795"/>, <xref target="OTN-TOPO"/>, <xref target="CLIENT-TOPO"/>,
   <xref target="TE-TUNNEL"/>, <xref target="PATH-COMPUTE"/>, <xref target="OTN-TUNNEL"/> and <xref target="CLIENT-SIGNAL"/> can be
   used together to control a multi-domain OTN network to support
   different types of multi-domain services, such as ODU transit
   services, Transparent client services and EPL/EVPL Ethernet
   services, over a multi-domain OTN connection, satisfying also the
   requirements in <xref target="ONF_TR-527"/>.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="Domain">
  A domain, as defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>, is “any collection of
   network elements within a common sphere of address management or
   path computation responsibility”.  Specifically, within this
   document, we mean a part of an operator’s network that is under
   common management (i.e., under shared operational management using
   the same instances of a tool and the same policies).  Network
   elements will often be grouped into domains based on technologies,
   vendor profiles, or geographic proximity.</t>
  <t hangText="CNC">
  Customer Network Controller</t>
  <t hangText="Connection">
  The data plane configuration of an LSP, within this
   document it is typically an ODU LSP. An end-to-end connection/LSP
   represents an entire connection/LSP between the connection/LSP node
   end-points. A connection/LSP segment represents a portion of the
   end-to-end connection/LSP.</t>
  <t hangText="Connectivity Service">
  A service, or connectivity service, in the
   context of this document can be considered as some form of
   connectivity service between customer sites across the network
   operator’s network <xref target="RFC8309"/>.</t>

  <t hangText="ILL">
  Inter-Layer Lock</t>
  <t hangText="Link">
  A link, or a physical link, is used to reprent the adjacency
   between two physical nodes. The term OTN link represents a link
   between two OTN switching physical nodes.</t>

  Provisioning Network Controller</t>
  <t hangText="Protection Switching">
  Protection switching, as defined in <xref target="ITU-T_G.808.1"/>
   and <xref target="RFC4427"/>, provides the capability to swith the traffic
   in case of network failurs over pre-allocated networks resourse.
   Typically linear protection methods would be used and configured to
   operate as 1+1 unidirectional, 1+1 bidirectional or 1:n
   bidirectional. This ensures fast and simple service survivability.</t>
  <t hangText="Protection Transport Entity/LSP">
  A protection transport entity/LSP,
   as defined in <xref target="ITU-T_G.808.1"/> and <xref target="RFC4427"/>, represents the path
   where the “normal” user traffic is transported during protection
   switching events (e.g., when the working transport entity/LSP
   fails).</t>
  <t hangText="Restoration">
  Restoration methods, as defined in <xref target="RFC4427"/>, provide
   the capability to reroute and restore traffic around network
   failures without the necessity to allocate network resources as
   required for dedicated 1+1 protection schemes. On the other hand,
   restoration times are typically longer than protection switching
   times.</t>
  <t hangText="Service Model">
  As described in <xref target="RFC8309"/> it describes a service and
   the parameters of the service in a portable way that can be used
   uniformly and independent of the equipment and operating
   environment.</t>
  <t hangText="TE Link">
  As defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, it is an element of a TE topology,
   presented as an edge on TE graph.</t>
  <t hangText="TE Tunnel">
  As defined in <xref target="TE-TUTORIAL"/>, it is a connection-oriented
   service provided by a layer network of delivery of a client’s data
   between source and destination tunnel termination points.</t>
  <t hangText="TE Tunnel Segment">
  As defined in <xref target="TE-TUTORIAL"/>, it is a part of a
   multi-domain TE tunnel that spans.</t>
  <t hangText="TE Tunnel Hand-off">
  As defined in <xref target="TE-TUTORIAL"/>, it is an access
   link or inter-domain link by which a multi-domain TE tunnel enters
   or exits a given network domain.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note - The three definitions above are currently in <xref target="TE-TUTORIAL"/>
   but it is expected that they will be moved to <xref target="TE-TUNNEL"/>. When this
   happens, the reference will be updated and the <xref target="TE-TUTORIAL"/>
   reference will be downgraded to Informative.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="TPN">
  Tributary Port Number</t>
  <t hangText="TTP">
  Tunnel Termination Point</t>
  <t hangText="Termination and Adaptation">
  It represents the termination of a
   server-layer connection at the node edge-point and the
   adaptation/mapping of the client layer traffic over the terminated
   server-layer connection.</t>
  <t hangText="Transparent Client">
  As defined in <xref target="CLIENT-SIGNAL"/>, it represents a
   client-layer signal, such as Ethernet physical interfaces, FC, STM-
   n, that cannot be switched but only mapped over a server-layer TE
   Tunnel.</t>
  <t hangText="Working Transport Entity/LSP">
  A working transport entity/LSP, as

<section anchor="conventions" title="Conventions Used in this Document">

<section anchor="process-convention" title="Topology and Traffic Flow Processing">

<t>The traffic flow between different nodes is specified as an ordered
   list of nodes, separated with commas, indicating within the brackets
   the processing within each node:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      <node> [<processing>]{, <node> [<processing>]}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The order represents the order of traffic flow being forwarded
   through the network.</t>

<t>The &lt;processing&gt; represents the type of processing performed by the
   node, which can be just switching at a given layer
   “(switching-layer)” or it can also include an adaptation of a client
   layer into a server layer: “(client-layer) -&gt; server-layer” or
   “client-layer -&gt; (server-layer)”, where the round brackets are used
   to represent at which layer (client layer or server layer) the node
   is switching.</t>

<t>For example, the following traffic flow:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      R1 [(PKT) -> ODU2], S3 [(ODU2)], S5 [(ODU2)], S6 [(ODU2)],
      R3 [ODU2 -> (PKT)]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>Node R1 is switching at the packet (PKT) layer and mapping packets
   into an ODU2 before transmission to node S3. Nodes S3, S5 and S6,
   are switching at the ODU2 layer: S3 sends the ODU2 traffic to S5,
   which then sends it to S6 which finally sends to R3. Node R3
   terminates the ODU2 from S6 before switching at the packet (PKT)
   layer.</t>

<t>The paths of working and protection transport entities are specified
   as an ordered list of nodes, separated with commas:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      <node> {, <node>}
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The order represents the order of traffic flow being forwarded
   through the network in the forward direction. In the case of
   bidirectional paths, the forward and backward directions are
   selected arbitrarily, but the convention is consistent between
   working/protection path pairs, as well as across multiple domains.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="json-code" title="JSON code">

<t>This document provides some detailed JSON code examples to describe
   how the YANG models being developed by the IETF (TEAS and CCAMP WG
   in particular) may be used. The scenario examples are provided using
   JSON to facilitate readability.</t>

<t>Different objects need to have an identifier. The convention used to
   create mnemonic identifiers is to use the object name (e.g., S3 for
   node S3), followed by its type (e.g., NODE), separated by an “-“,
   followed by “-ID”. For example, the mnemonic identifier for node S3
   would be S3-NODE-ID.</t>

<t>The JSON language does not support the insertion of comments that
   have been instead found to be useful when writing the examples. This
   document will insert comments into the JSON code as JSON name/value
   pair with the JSON name string starting with the “//” characters.
   For example, when describing the example of a TE Topology instance
   representing the ODU Abstract Topology exposed by the Transport PNC,
   the following comment has been added to the JSON code:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      "// comment": "ODU Abstract Topology @ MPI",
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The JSON code examples provided in this document have been validated
   against the YANG models following the validation process described
   in <xref target="json-validation"/>, which would not consider the comments.</t>

<t>To have successful validation of the examples, some numbering scheme
   has been defined to assign identifiers to the different entities
   which would pass the syntax checks. In that case, to simplify the
   reading, another JSON name/value pair formatted as a comment and
   using the mnemonic identifiers is also provided. For example, the
   identifier of node S3 (S3-NODE-ID) has been assumed to be “10.0.0.3”
   and would be shown in the JSON code example using the two JSON
   name/value pair:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      "// te-node-id": "S3-NODE-ID",

      "te-node-id": "10.0.0.3",
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The first JSON name/value pair will be automatically removed in the
   first step of the validation process, while the second JSON
   name/value pair will be validated against the YANG model
   definitions.</t>

<t>This document assumes that all the Si transport network switching
   nodes are capable of switching in the electrical domain (ODU
   switching) moreover, that all the Si-Sj OTN links within the
   transport network (intra-domain or inter-domain) are 100G links
   while the access Ri-Sj links are 10G links.</t>

<t>This document also assumes that within the transport network, the
   physical/optical connections supporting the Si-Sj OTN links (up to
   the OTU4 trail), are pre-provisioned using mechanisms which are
   outside the scope of this document and are not exposed at the MPIs
   to the MDSC.</t>

<t>Different transmission technologies can be used on the access links
   (e.g., Ethernet, STM-N and OTU).
   <xref target="service-description"/> provides more details
   about the different assumptions on the access links for different
   types of connectivity services and
   <xref target="multi-function-access"/> describes the control
   of access links which can support different technology
   configurations (e.g., STM-64, 10GE or OTU2) depending on the type of
   service being configured (multi-function access links).</t>

<t>To carry client signals (e.g., Ethernet or STM-N) over OTN, some ODU
   termination and adaptation resources need to be available on the
   physical edge nodes (e.g., node S3 and S18). The location of these
   resources within the physical node is implementation specific and
   outside the scope of standardization. This document assumes that
   these termination and adaptation resources are located on the
   physical interfaces of the edge nodes terminating the access links.
   In other words, each physical access link has a set dedicated ODU
   termination and adaptation resources.</t>

<t>The transport network control architecture,
   shown in <xref target="fig-control-hierarchy"/>,
   follows the ACTN architecture as defined in the ACTN framework
   document <xref target="RFC8453"/>, and uses the same functional components:</t>

<t>The NEs within network domains 1, 2 and 3 of <xref target="fig-reference-network"/> are
   controlled, respectively, by PNC1, PNC2 and PNC3 of <xref target="fig-control-hierarchy"/>. The
   MDSC control the end-to-end network through the MPIs toward the
   underlying PNCs.</t>

<t>The ACTN framework facilitates the separation of the network and
   service control from the underlying technology. It helps the
   customer to define the network as desired by business needs. The CMI
   is defined to keep a minimal level of dependency (or no dependency
   at all) from the underlying network technologies. The MPI instead
   requires some specialization according to the domain technology.</t>

<t>The control interfaces within the scope of this document are the
   three MPIs, as shown in <xref target="fig-control-hierarchy"/>.</t>

<t>The split of functionality at the MPI in the ACTN architecture
   between the MDSC (multi-domain controller) and the PNCs (domain
   controllers), is equivalent to separation functionality assumed in
   the ONF T-API interface, as described in the ONF T-API multi-domain
   use cases <xref target="ONF_TR-527"/>. Furthermore, this functional separation is
   similarly defined in the MEF PRESTO interface between the Service
   Orchestration Functionality (SOF) and the Infrastructure Control and
   Management (ICM) in the MEF LSO Architecture <xref target="MEF55"/>.</t>

<t>This document does not make any assumption about the control
   architecture of the customer IP network: in line with <xref target="RFC8453"/>, the
   CNC is just a functional component within the customer control
   architecture which is capable of requesting connectivity services on
   demand between IP routers at the CMI.</t>

<t>The CNC can request connectivity services between IP routers which
   can be attached to different transport network domains (e.g.,
   between R1 and R8 in <xref target="fig-reference-network"/>) or to the same transport network
   domain (e.g., between R1 and R3 in <xref target="fig-reference-network"/>). Since the CNC is not
   aware of the transport network controller hierarchy, the mechanisms
   used by the CNC to request connectivity services at the CMI is also
   unaware whether the requested service spans a single-domain or
   multi-domains.</t>

<t>It is assumed that the CMI allows the CNC to provide all the
   necessary information needed by the MDSC to understand the
   connectivity service request and to determine the network
   configurations to be requested, at the MPIs, to its underlying PNCs
   to support the requested connectivity service.</t>

<t>The MDSC, after having received a single-domain service request from
   the CNC at the CMI (e.g., between R1 and R3 in <xref target="fig-reference-network"/>), can follow
   the same procedures, described above for the multi-domain service,
   and decide the network configuration to request only at the MPI of
   the PNC controlling that domain (e.g., MPI1 of PNC1 in <xref target="fig-control-hierarchy"/>).</t>

<section anchor="topology-description" title="Topology Abstractions">

<t>Abstraction provides a selective method for representing
   connectivity information within a domain. There are multiple methods
   to abstract a network topology. This document assumes the
   abstraction method defined in <xref target="RFC7926"/>:</t>

<t><list style='empty'>
  <t>Abstraction is the process of applying the policy to the
 available TE information within a domain, to produce selective
 information that represents the potential ability to connect
 across the domain.  Thus, abstraction does not necessarily offer
 all possible connectivity options, but presents a general view of
 potential connectivity according to the policies that determine
 how the domain’s administrator wants to allow the domain resources
 to be used.</t>
</list></t>

<t><xref target="RFC8453"/> Provides the context of topology abstraction in the ACTN
   architecture and discusses a few alternatives for the abstraction
   methods for both packet and optical networks. This is an important
   consideration since the choice of the abstraction method impacts
   protocol design and the information it carries.  According to
   <xref target="RFC8453"/>, there are three types of topologies:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>White topology: This is a case where the PNC provides the actual
network topology to the MDSC without any hiding or filtering. In
this case, the MDSC has the full knowledge of the underlying
network topology;</t>
  <t>Black topology: The entire domain network is abstracted as a
single virtual node with the access links and inter-domain links
without disclosing any node internal connectivity information;</t>
  <t>Grey topology: This abstraction level is between black topology
and white topology from a granularity point of view.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Each PNC should provide the MDSC a network topology abstraction
   hiding the internal details of the physical domain network topology
   controlled by the PNC. As described in section 3 of <xref target="RFC8453"/>, the
   level of abstraction provided by each PNC is based on the PNC
   configuration parameters and it is independent of the abstractions
   provided by other PNCs. Therefore, it is possible that different
   PNCs provide different types of topology abstractions. The MDSC can
   operate on each MPI abstract topology regardless of, and
   independently from, the type of abstraction provided by its
   underlying PNC.</t>

<t>For analyzing how the MDSC can operate on an abstract topology
   provided by several PNcs that independently applied different
   abstraction policies and therefore provided different types of
   abstract topologies, the following assumptions are made for the
   reference network in <xref target="fig-reference-network"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PNC1 and PNC2 provide black topology abstractions which expose at
MPI1, and MPI2 respectively, a single virtual node (representing
the whole network domain 1, and domain 2 respectively).</t>
  <t>PNC3 provides a white topology abstraction which exposes at MPI3
all the physical nodes and links within network domain 3.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The MDSC should be capable of stitching together the abstracted
   topologies provided by each PNC to build its view of the multi-
   domain network topology. This topology knowledge may require proper
   oversight, including the application of local policy, configuration
   methods, and the application of a trust model. Methods of how to
   manage these aspects are out of scope for this document, but
   recomandations are provided in the Security section of this
   document.</t>

<t>The MDSC can also provide topology abstraction of its view of the
   multi-domain network topology at its CMIs depending on the
   customers’ needs and policies: it can provide different types of
   topology abstractions at different CMIs. Analyzing the topology
   abstractions provided by the MDSC to its CMIs is outside the scope
   of this document.</t>

<section anchor="service-description" title="Service Configuration">

<t>In the following scenarios, it is assumed that the CNC is capable of
   requesting connectivity services from the MDSC, for example to
   interconnect IP routers.</t>

<t>The type of connectivity services depends on the type of physical
   links (e.g. OTN link, ETH link or SDH link) between the routers and
   transport network.</t>

<t>The packet processing inside IP routers, including packet
   encapsualation and decapsulation, Ri (PKT -&gt; foo) and Rj (foo -&gt;
   PKT), are assumed to be performed by means that are not under the
   control of, and not visible to, the MDSC nor to the PNCs. Therefore,
   these mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="odu-description" title="ODU Transit">

<t>The physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport
   network can be 10G OTN links.</t>

<t>In this case, it is assumed that the physical/optical
   interconnections below the ODU layer (up to the OTU2 trail) are
   pre-provisioned using mechanisms which are outside the scope of this
   document and not exposed at the MPIs between the PNCs and the MDSC.</t>

<t>For simplicity of the description, it is also assumed that these
   interfaces are not channelized (i.e., they can only support one
   ODU2).</t>

<t>When a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R8 is needed, an ODU2 end-to-end
   connection needs to be created, passing through transport network
   nodes S3, S1, S2, S31, S33, S34, S15 and S18 which belong to
   different PNC domains (multi-domain service request):</t>

      S15 [(ODU2)], S18 [(ODU2)], R8 [ODU2 -> (PKT)]

<t>The MDSC receives, at the CMI,the request to create an ODU2 transit
   service between the access links on S3 and S18, which belong to
   different PNC domains (multi-domain service request). The MDSC also
   determines the network configuration requests to be sent to its
   underlying PNCs, at the MPIs, to coordinate the setup of a multi-
   domain ODU2 connection segment between the access links on S3 and
   S18.</t>

<t>When a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R3 is needed, an ODU2 end-to-end
   connection needs to be created, passing through transport network

<t>As described in <xref target="reference-network"/>,
   the mechanisms, used by the CNC at the
   CMI, are independent on whether the service request is single-domain
   service or multi-domain.</t>

<t>The MDSC can figure out that it needs to setup an ODU2 transit
   service between the access links on S3 and S6, which belong to the
   same PNC domain (single-domain service request) and it decides the
   proper network configuration to request PNC1.</t>

<section anchor="epl-description" title="EPL over ODU">

<t>The physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport

<t>When a 10Gb IP link between between R1 and R8 is needed, an EPL

<section anchor="client-description" title="Transparent Client Services">

   InfiniBand, etc.) interconnecting the IP routers and the transport
   network.</t>

<t>When a 10Gb IP link between R1 and R8 is needed, using, for example
   SDH physical links between the IP routers and the transport network,
   an STM-64 Private Line service needs to be created, supported by an
   ODU2 end-to-end connection, between transport network nodes S3 and

<t>As described (<xref target="reference-network"/>) the CNC provides the essential

   access links on S3 and S8, and it also decides the network
   configurations, including the configuration of the adaptation
   functions inside these edge nodes, such as S3 [STM-64 -&gt; (ODU2)] and
   S18 [(ODU2) -&gt; STM-64].</t>

<section anchor="evpl-description" title="EVPL over ODU">

<t>When the physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the
   transport network are Ethernet physical links, it is also possible
   that different Ethernet services (e.g., EVPL) can share the same
   physical access link using different VLANs.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="epl-description"/>, it is assumed that the Ethernet
   physical interfaces (up to the MAC layer) are pre-provisioned.</t>

<t>When two 1Gb IP links between R1 to R2 and between R1 and R8 are
   needed, two EVPL services need to be created, supported by two ODU0
   end-to-end connections:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

      S15 [(ODU0)], S18 [(ODU0) -> VLAN], R8[VLAN -> (PKT)]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>It is worth noting that the first EVPL service is required between
   access links which belong to the same PNC domain (single-domain
   service request) while the second EVPL service is required between
   access links which belong to different PNC domains (multi-domain
   service request).</t>

<t>Since the two EVPL services are sharing the same Ethernet physical
   link between R1 and S3, different VLAN IDs are associated with
   different EVPL services: for example, VLAN IDs 10 and 20
   respectively.</t>

<t>Based on the assumptions described in <xref target="epl-description"/>, the CNC sends a
   request to the MDSC, at the CMI, to setup these EVPL services. The
   MDSC will determine the network configurations to request to the
   underlying PNCs, as described in <xref target="epl-description"/>.</t>

<section anchor="multi-function-access" title="Multi-function Access Links">

<t>Some physical links interconnecting the IP routers and the transport
   network can be configured in different modes, e.g., as OTU2 trail or
   STM-64 or 10GE physical links.</t>

<t>This configuration can be pre-provisioned by means which are outside
   the scope of this document. In this case, these links will appear at
   the MPI as links supporting only one mode (depending on how the link
   has been pre-provisioned) and will be controlled at the MPI as
   discussed in <xref target="service-description"/>:
   for example, a 10G multi-function access
   link can be pre-provisioned as an OTU2 trail (<xref target="odu-description"/>), a 10GE
   physical link (<xref target="epl-description"/>) or an STM-64 physical link
   (<xref target="client-description"/>).</t>

<t>It is also possible not to configure these links a-priori and let
   the MDSC (or, in case of a single-domain service request, the PNC)
   decide how to configure these links, based on the service
   configuration.</t>

<t>For example, if the physical link between R1 and S3 is a
   multi-functional access link while the physical links between R4 and
   S6 and between R8 and S18 are STM-64 and 10GE physical links
   respectively, it is possible to configure either an STM-64 Private
   Line service between R1 and R4 or an EPL service between R1 and R8.</t>

<t>The traffic flow between R1 and R4 can be summarized as:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      R1 [(PKT) -> STM-64], S3 [STM-64 -> (ODU2)], S5 [(ODU2)],

<t>The CNC is capable of requesting, via the CMI, the setup either an
   STM-64 Private Line service, between R1 and R4, or an EPL service,
   between R1 and R8.</t>

<t>The MDSC, based on the service being request, decides the network
   configurations to request, at the MPIs, to its underlying PNCs, to
   coordinate the setup of an end-to-end ODU2 connection, either
   between nodes S3 and S6, or between nodes S3 and S18, including the
   configuration of the adaptation functions on these edge nodes, and
   in particular whether the multi-function access link between R1 and
   S3 should operate as an STM-64 or as a 10GE physical link.</t>

   PNC and MDSC should coordinate together to determine the
   notification policy. This will include information such as when an
   intra-domain alarm occurred. The PNC may not report the alarm, but
   it should provide notification of the service state change to the
   MDSC.</t>

<t>Analysis and methods of how event alarms are triggered, managed and
   propagated are outside the scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="path-computation-with-constraints" title="Path Computation with Constraints">

<t>It is possible to define constraints to be taken into account during
   path computation procedures (e.g., IRO/XRO).</t>

<t>For example, the CNC can request, at the CMI, an ODU transit
   service, as described in <xref target="odu-description"/>, between R1 and R8 with the
   constraint to pass through the link from S2 to S31 (IRO), such that
   a qualified path could be:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      R1 [(PKT) -> ODU2], S3 [(ODU2]), S1 [(ODU2]), S2 [(ODU2]),
      S31 [(ODU2)], S33 [(ODU2)], S34 [(ODU2)],
      S15 [(ODU2)], S18 [(ODU2)], R8 [ODU2 -> (PKT)]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>If the CNC instead requested to pass through the link from S8 to
   S12, then the above path would not be qualified, while the following
   would be:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
      R1 [(PKT) -> ODU2], S3[(ODU2]), S1 [(ODU2]), S2[(ODU2]),
      S8 [(ODU2]), S12[(ODU2]), S15 [(ODU2]), S18[(ODU2]), R8 [ODU2 ->
      (PKT)]
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The mechanisms, used by the CNC to provide path constraints at the
   CMI, are outside the scope of this document. It is assumed that the
   MDSC can satisfy these constraints and take them into account in its
   path computation procedures (which would decide at least which
   domains and inter-domain links) and in the path computation
   constraints to provide to its underlying PNCs, to be taken into
   account in the path computation procedures implemented by the PNCs
   (with a more detailed view of topology).</t>

<section anchor="analysis" title="YANG Model Analysis">

<t>This section analyses how the IETF YANG models can be used at the
   MPIs, between the MDSC and the PNCs, to support the scenarios
   described in <xref target="scenarios"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG models described in <xref target="ACTN-YANG"/> are assumed to be used at
   the MPI.</t>

<t><xref target="topology-analysis"/> describes the different topology abstractions provided
   to the MDSC by each PNC via its own MPI.</t>

<t><xref target="service-analysis"/> describes how the MDSC can request different PNCs, via
   their own MPIs, the network configuration needed to setup the
   different services described in <xref target="service-description"/>.</t>

<t><xref target="protection-analysis"/> describes how the protection scenarios can be deployed,
   including end-to-end protection and segment protection, for both
   intra-domain and inter-domain scenario.</t>

<section anchor="topology-analysis" title="YANG Models for Topology Abstraction">

<t>This section analyses how each PNC can report its respective
   abstract topology to the MDSC, as described in <xref target="topology-description"/>, using
   the Topology YANG models, defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/>, with the TE Topology
   YANG augmentations, provided in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, and the OTN
   technology-specific YANG augmentations, defined in <xref target="OTN-TOPO"/> or the
   Ethernet client technology-specific YANG augmentations, defined in
   <xref target="CLIENT-TOPO"/>.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="reference-network"/>, the OTU4 trails on inter-domain and
   intra-domain physical links are pre-provisioned and therefore not
   exposed at the MPIs. Only the TE Links they support can be exposed
   at the MPI, depending on the topology abstraction performed by the
   PNC.</t>

<t>The access links can be multi-function access links, as described in
   <xref target="multi-function-access"/>.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="reference-network"/>, each physical access link has a
   dedicated set of ODU termination and adaptation resources.</t>

<t>The <xref target="OTN-TOPO"/> model allows reporting within the OTN abstract
   topology also the access links which are capable of supporting the
   transparent client layers, defined in <xref target="client-description"/> and in
   <xref target="CLIENT-SIGNAL"/>. These links can also be multi-function access links
   that can be configured as a transparent client physical links (e.g.,
   STM-64 physical link) or as an OTUk trail.</t>

<t>In order to support the EPL and EVPL services, described in
   <xref target="epl-description"/> and <xref target="epl-description"/>,
   the access links, which are capable of being
   configured as Ethernet physical links, are reported by each PNC
   within its respective Ethernet abstract topology, using the Topology
   YANG models, defined in <xref target="RFC8345"/>, with the TE Topology YANG
   augmentations, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>, and the Ethernet client
   technology-specific YANG augmentations, defined in <xref target="CLIENT-TOPO"/>.
   These links can also be multi-function access links that can be
   configured as an Ethernet physical link, an OTUk trail, or as a
   transparent client physical links (e.g., STM-64 physical link). In
   this case, these physical access links are represented in both the
   OTN and Ethernet abstract topologies.</t>

<t>The PNC reports the capabilities of the access or inter-domain link
   ends it can control. It is the MDSC responsibility to request
   configuration of these links matching the capabilities of both link
   ends.</t>

<t>It is worth noting that in the network scenarios analyzed in this
   document (where switching is performed only at the ODU layer), the
   Ethernet abstract topologies reported by the PNCs describes only the
   Ethernet client access links: no Ethernet TE switching capabilities
   are reported in these Ethernet abstract topologies, to report that
   the underlying networt domain is not capable to support Ethernet TE
   Tunnels/LSPs.</t>

<section anchor="domain1-topo" title="Domain 1 Black Topology Abstraction">

<t>The OTU4 trails on the inter-domain physical links (e.g., the link
   between S2 and S31) are pre-provisioned and exposed as external TE
   Links, within the MPI1 OTN topology (e.g., the external TE Link
   terminating on AN1-7 TE Link Termination Point (LTP) abstracting the
   OTU4 trail between S2 and S31).</t>

<t>The PNC1 exports at MPI1 the following external TE Links, within the
   MPI1 OTN topology, representing the multi-function access links
   under its control:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>two abstract TE Links, terminating on LTP AN1-1 and AN1-2
respectively, abstracting the physical access link between S3 and
R1 and the access link between S6 and R3 respectively, reporting
that they can support STM-64 client signals as well as ODU2
connections;</t>
  <t>one abstract TE Link, terminating on LTP AN1-3, abstracting the
physical access link between S6 and R4, reporting that it can
support STM-64 client signals but no ODU2 connections.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The information about the 10GE access link between S6 and R2 as well
   as the fact that the access link between S3 and R1 can also be
   configured as a 10GE link cannot be exposed by PNC1 within the MPI1
   OTN topology.</t>

<t>Therefore, PNC1 exports at MPI1, within the MPI1 ETH topology, two
   abstract TE Links, terminating on LTP AN1-1 and AN1-8 respectively,
   abstracting the physical access link between S3 and R1 and the
   access link between S6 and R2 respectively, reporting that they can
   support Ethernet client signal with port-based and VLAN-based
   classifications.</t>

<t>PNC1 should expose at MPI1 also the ODU termination and adaptation
   resources which are available to carry client signals (e.g.,
   Ethernet or STM-N) over OTN. This information is reported by the
   Tunnel Termination Points (TTPs) within the MPI1 OTN Topology.</t>

<t>In particular, PNC1 will report, within the MPI1 OTN Topology, one
   TTP for each access link (i.e., AN1-1, AN1-2, AN1-3 and AN1-8) and
   will assign a transition link or an inter-layer lock identifier,
   which is unique across all the TE Topologies PNC1 is exposing at
   MPI1, to each TTP and access link’s LTP pair.</t>

<t>For simplicity purposes, this document assigns the same number to
   the LTP-ID, TTP-ID and ILL-ID that corresponds to the same access
   link (i.e., 1, 2, 3 and 8 respectively for the LTP, TTP and
   Inter-Layer Lock (IIL) corresponding with the access links AN1-1,
   AN1-2, AN1-3 and AN1-8).</t>

   topology of the domain controlled by the PNC, as shown in

<section anchor="multi-domain-topo" title="Multi-domain Topology Merging">

<t>MDSC does not have any knowledge of the topologies of each domain
   until each PNC reports its own abstract topologies, so the MDSC
   needs to merge these abstract topologies, provided by different
   PNCs, to build its own topology view of the multi-domain network
   (MDSC multi-domain native topology), as described in section 4.3 of
   <xref target="RFC8795"/>.</t>

<t>The topology of each domain may be in an abstracted shape (refer to
   section 5.2 of <xref target="RFC8453"/> for a different level of abstraction),
   while the inter-domain link information must be complete and fully
   configured by the MDSC.</t>

<t>The inter-domain link information is reported to the MDSC by the two
   PNCs, controlling the two ends of the inter-domain link.</t>

<t>The MDSC needs to know how to merge these inter-domain links. One
   possibility is to use the plug-id information, defined in <xref target="RFC8795"/>:
   two inter-domain TE links, within two different MPI abstract
   topologies, terminating on two LTPs reporting the same plug-id value
   can be merged as a single intra-domain link, within any MDSC native
   topology.</t>

<t>The value of the reported plug-id information can be either assigned
   by a central network authority and configured within the two PNC
   domains. Alternatively, it may be discovered using an automatic
   discovery mechanisms (e.g., LMP-based, as defined in <xref target="RFC6898"/>).</t>

<t>In case the plug-id values are assigned by a central authority, it
   is under the central authority responsibility to assign unique
   values.</t>

<t>In case the plug-id values are automatically discovered, the
   information discovered by the automatic discovery mechanisms needs
   to be encoded as a bit string within the plug-id value. This
   encoding is implementation-specific, but the encoding rules need to
   be consistent across all the PNCs.</t>

<t>In case of co-existence within the same network of multiple sources
   for the plug-id (e.g., central authority and automatic discovery or
   even different automatic discovery mechanisms), it is needed that
   the plug-id namespace is partitioned to avoid that different sources
   assign the same plug-id value to different inter-domain links. Also,
   the encoding of the plug-id namespace within the plug-id value is
   implementation specific and will need to be consistent across all
   the PNCs.</t>

<t>This document assumes that the plug-id is assigned by a central
   authority, with the first octet set to 0x00 to represent the central
   authority namespace. The configuration method used, within each PNC
   domain, are outside the scope of this document.</t>

<t>For example, this document assumes that the following plug-id values
   are assigned, by administrative configuration, to the inter-domain
   links shown in <xref target="fig-reference-network"/>:</t>

<section anchor="service-analysis" title="YANG Models for Service Configuration">

<t>This section analyses how the MDSC can request the different PNCs to
   setup different multi-domains services, as described in <xref target="service-description"/>,
   using the TE Tunnel YANG model, defined in <xref target="TE-TUNNEL"/>, with the OTN
   technology-specific augmentations, defined in <xref target="OTN-TUNNEL"/> with the

<t>The service configuration procedure is assumed to be initiated (step

   models is (e.g., L1CSM, L2SM, VN) is outside the scope of this
   document, but it is assumed that the CMI YANG models provide all the
   information that allows the MDSC to understand that it needs to
   coordinate the setup of a multi-domain ODU data plane connection
   (which can be either an end-to-end connection or a segment
   connection) and, when needed, also the configuration of the
   adaptation functions in the edge nodes belonging to different

<t>As an example, the objective in this section is to configure a
   connectivity service between R1 and R8, such as one of the services
   described in <xref target="service-description"/>.
   The inter-domain path is assumed to be R1
   &lt;-&gt; S3 &lt;-&gt; S1 &lt;-&gt; S2 &lt;-&gt; S31 &lt;-&gt; S33 &lt;-&gt; S34 &lt;-&gt;S15 &lt;-&gt; S18 &lt;-&gt; R8
   (see the physical topology in <xref target="fig-reference-network"/>).</t>

<t>According to the different client signal types, different
   adaptations can be required to be configured at the edge nodes
   (i.e., S3 and S18).</t>

<t>After receiving such request, MDSC determines the domain sequence,
   i.e., domain 1 &lt;-&gt; domain 3 &lt;-&gt; domain 2, with corresponding PNCs
   and the inter-domain links (step 2 in <xref target="fig-svc-setup"/>).</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="PATH-COMPUTE"/>, the domain sequence can be
   determined by running the MDSC own path computation on the MDSC
   native topology, defined in <xref target="multi-domain-topo"/>, if and only if the MDSC
   has enough topology information. Otherwise, the MDSC can send path
   computation requests to the different PNCs (steps 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
   in <xref target="fig-svc-setup"/>) and use this information to determine the optimal path
   on its internal topology and therefore the domain sequence.</t>

<t>The MDSC will then decompose the tunnel request into a few TE tunnel
   segments and request different PNCs to setup each intra-domain TE
   tunnel segment (steps 3, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in <xref target="fig-svc-setup"/>).</t>

<t>The MDSC will take care of the configuration of both the intra-
   domain TE tunnel segments and inter-domain TE tunnel hand-off via
   corresponding MPI (using the TE tunnel YANG model defined in
   <xref target="TE-TUNNEL"/> and the OTN tunnel YANG model augmentations defined in
   <xref target="OTN-TUNNEL"/>) through all the PNCs controlling the domains selected
   during path computation. More specifically, for the inter-domain TE
   tunnel hand-off, taking into account that the inter-domain links are
   all OTN links, the list of timeslots and the TPN value assigned to
   that ODUk connection at the inter-domain link needs to be configured
   by the MDSC.</t>

<t>The configuration of the timeslots and the TPN value used by the
   ODU2 connection on the internal links within a PNC domain (i.e., on
   the internal links within domain1) is outside the scope of this
   document, since it is a matter of the PNC domain internal
   implementation.</t>

<t>However, the configuration of the timeslots used by the ODU2
   connection at the transport network domain boundaries (e.g., on the
   inter-domain links) needs to take into account the timeslots
   available on physical nodes belonging to different PNC domains
   (e.g., on node S2 within PNC1 domain and node S31 within PNC3
   domain). Each PNC provides to the MDSC, at the MPI, the list of
   available timeslots on the inter-domain links using the TE Topology</t>

<t>YANG model and OTN Topology augmentation. The TE Topology YANG model
   in <xref target="RFC8795"/> is being updated to report the label set information.
   See section 1.7 of <xref target="TE-TUTORIAL"/> for more details.</t>

<t>The MDSC, when coordinating the setup of a multi-domain ODU
   connection, also configures the data plane resources (i.e., the list
   of timeslots and the TPN) to be used on the inter-domain links. The
   MDSC can know the timeslots which are available on the physical OTN
   nodes terminating the inter-domain links (e.g., S2 and S31) from the
   OTN Topology information exposed, at the MPIs, by the PNCs
   controlling the OTN physical nodes (e.g., PNC1 and PNC3 controlling
   the physical nodes S2 and S31 respectively).</t>

<t>In any case, the access link configuration is done only on the PNCs
   that control the access links (e.g., PNC-1 and PNC-3) and not on the
   PNCs of transit domain(s) (e.g., PNC-2). An access link will be
   configured by MDSC after the OTN tunnel is set up.</t>

<t>Access configuration will vary and will be dependent on each type of
   service. Further discussion and examples are provided in the
   following sub-sections.</t>

<section anchor="odu-analysis" title="ODU Transit Service">

<t>In this scenario, described in <xref target="odu-description"/>, the physical access
   links are configured as 10G OTN links and, as described in 
   <xref target="topology-analysis"/>, reported by each PNC as TE Links within the OTN abstract
   topologies they expose to the MDSC.</t>

<t>When an IP link, between R1 and R8 is needed, the CNC requests, at
   the CMI, the MDSC to setup an ODU transit service.</t>

<t>From its native topology, shown in <xref target="fig-mdsc-topo"/>, the MDSC understands,
   by means which are outside the scope of this document, that R1 is
   attached to the access link terminating on AN1-1 LTP in the MPI1 OTN
   Abstract Topology (<xref target="fig-mpi1-otn-topo"/>), exposed by PNC1, and that R8 is
   attached to the access link terminating on AN2-1 LTP in the MPI2
   Abstract Topology, exposed by PNC2.</t>

<t>MDSC then performs multi-domain path computation (step 2 in
   <xref target="fig-svc-setup"/>) and requests PNC1, PNC2 and PNC3, at MPI1, MPI2 and MPI3
   respectively, to setup ODU2 (Transit Segment) Tunnels within the OTN
   Abstract Topologies they expose (MPI1 OTN Abstract Topology, MPI2
   OTN Abstract Topology and MPI3 OTN Abstract Topology, respectively).</t>

<t>MDSC requests, at MPI1, PNC1 to setup an ODU2 (Transit Segment)
   Tunnel with one primary path between AN-1 and AN1-7 LTPs, within the
   MPI1 OTN Abstract Topology (<xref target="fig-mpi1-otn-topo"/>), using the TE Tunnel YANG
   model, defined in <xref target="TE-TUNNEL"/>, with the OTN technology-specific
   augmentations, defined in <xref target="OTN-TUNNEL"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">

</list></t>

<t><xref target="json-mpi1-odu2-svc"/>
   provides the detailed JSON code (“mpi1-odu2-service-
   config.json”) describing how the setup of this ODU2 (Transit
   Segment) Tunnel can be requested by the MDSC, using the <xref target="TE-TUNNEL"/>
   and <xref target="OTN-TUNNEL"/> YANG models at MPI1.</t>

<t>PNC1 knows, as described in the mapping table in <xref target="domain1-topo"/>, that
   AN-1 and AN1-7 LTPs within the MPI1 OTN Abstract Topology it exposes
   at MPI1 correspond to the S3-1 and S2-3 LTPs, respectively, within
   its native topology. Therefore it performs path computation, for an
   ODU2 connection between these LTPs within its native topology, and
   sets up the ODU2 cross-connections within the physical nodes S3, S1
   and S2.</t>

<t>Since the R1-S3 access link is a multi-function access link, PNC1
   also configures the OTU2 trail before setting up the ODU2
   cross-connection in node S3.</t>

<t>As part of the OUD2 cross-connection configuration in node S2, PNC1
   configures the data plane resources (i.e., the list of timeslots and
   the TPN), to be used by this ODU2 connection on the S2-S31 inter-
   domain link, as requested by the MDSC.</t>

<t>Following similar requests from MDSC to setup ODU2 (Transit Segment)
   Tunnels within the OTN Abstract Topologies they expose, PNC2 then
   sets up ODU2 cross-connections on nodes S31 and S33 while PNC3 sets
   up ODU2 cross-connections on nodes S15 and S18. PNC2 also configures
   the OTU2 trail on the S18-R8 multi-function access link.</t>

<section anchor="single-domain-example" title="Single Domain Example">

<t>To setup an ODU2 end-to-end connection, supporting an IP link,
   between R1 and R3, the CNC requests, at the CMI, the MDSC to setup

   only PCN1 to setup the ODU2 (Transit Segment) Tunnel between the
   access links terminating on AN-1 and AN1-2 LTPs within the MPI1
   Abstract Topology and PNC1 sets up ODU2 cross-connections on nodes

   expose to the MDSC.</t>

<t>When this IP link, between R1 and R8, is needed, the CNC requests,
   at the CMI, the MDSC to setup an EPL service.</t>

<t>From its native topology, shown in <xref target="fig-mdsc-topo"/>, the MDSC understands,
   by means which are outside the scope of this document, that R1 is
   attached to the access link terminating on AN1-1 LTP in the MPI1 ETH
   Abstract Topology, exposed by PNC1, and that R8 is attached to the
   access link terminating on AN2-1 LTP in the MPI2 ETH Abstract
   Topology, exposed by PNC2.</t>

<t>Therefore, the MDSC also understands that it needs to coordinate the

   abstracting S3-1 and S18-3 TTPs, within the OTN Abstract Topologies
   exposed by PNC1 and PNC2, respectively.</t>

   AN1-1 TTP and the AN1-7 LTP, within the MPI1 OTN Abstract Topology
   it exposes at MPI1, correspond to S3-1 TTP and S2-3 LTP,
   respectively, within its native topology. Therefore it performs path
   computation, for an ODU2 connection between S3-1 TTP and S2-3 LTP
   within its native topology, and sets up the ODU2 cross-connections
   within the physical nodes S3, S1 and S2, as shown in <xref target="epl-description"/>.</t>

<t>As part of the OUD2 cross-connection configuration in node S2, PNC1
   configures the data plane resources (i.e., the list of timeslots and
   the TPN), to be used by this ODU2 connection on the S2-S31 inter-
   domain link, as requested by the MDSC.</t>

<t>After the configuration of the ODU2 cross-connection in node S3,
   PNC1 also configures the [ETH -&gt; (ODU)] and [(ODU2) -&gt; ETH]
   adaptation functions, within node S3, as shown in <xref target="epl-description"/>.</t>

<t>Since the R1-S3 access link is a multi-function access link, PNC1
   also configures the 10GE link before this step.</t>

<t>Following similar requests from MDSC to setup ODU2 (Segment) Tunnels
   within the OTN Abstract Topologies they expose as well as the
   steering of the Ethernet client traffic, PNC3 then sets up ODU2
   cross-connections on nodes S31 and S33 while PNC2 sets up ODU2
   cross-connections on nodes S15 and S18 as well as the [ETH -&gt;
   (ODU2)] and [(ODU2) -&gt; ETH] adaptation functions in node S18, as
   shown in <xref target="epl-description"/>. PNC2 also configures the 10GE link on the
   S18-R8 multi-function access link.</t>

<t>As described in <xref target="linear-protection-description"/>,
   the MDSC can decide to protect a

   protection switching between edge nodes controlled by different PNCs
   (e.g., nodes S3 and S8, controlled by PNC1 and PNC2 respectively, to

<t>MDSC performs path computation, as described in <xref target="service-analysis"/>, to
   compute both the paths for working and protection transport
   entities: the computed paths can pass through these same PNC domains
   or through different transit PNC domains.</t>

<t>Considering the case, described in <xref target="linear-protection-description"/>, where the working

<section anchor="segmented-protection-analysis" title="Segmented Protection">

<t>Under specific policies, it is possible to deploy a segmented
   protection for multi-domain services. The configuration of the

   the example in <xref target="segmented-protection-description"/>,
   the following steps would be used.</t>

<t>MDSC performs path computation, as described in <xref target="service-analysis"/>, to
   compute all the paths for working and protection transport entities,
   which pass through the same PNC domains and inter-domain links: the
   MDSC would perform the same steps described in <xref target="service-analysis"/> to setup

   correspond to S3-1 TTP and the S2-3 LTP, respectively, within its
   native topology. It also understands, from the route-object-include-

<t>configuration (whole last element represent an abstract node
   terminating the inter-domain link used for the primary path), that
   the protection group should be terminated in nodes S3 and S2.</t>

<t>PNC1 will perform path computations using its native topology and
   setup the ODU connections in nodes S3, S1, S2, S4 and S8 as well as
   configure the protection group in nodes S3 and S2.</t>

<t>Following similar requests from MDSC to setup ODU2 (Segment)
   Tunnels, with segment protection, within the OTN Abstract Topologies
   they expose. PNC3 then sets up ODU2 cross-connections on nodes S31,
   S32, S33 and S34 and segment protection between nodes S31 and D34.
   PNC2 sets up ODU2 cross-connections on nodes S15, S12, S17 and S18
   and segment protection between nodes S15 and S18.</t>

<t>MDSC stitch the configuration above to form its internal view of the
   end-to-end tunnel with segmented protection.</t>

<t>Given the configuration above, the protection capability has been
   deployed on the tunnels. The head-end node of each domain can do the
   switching once there is a failure on one the tunnel segment. For
   example, in Network domain 1, when there is a failure on the S1-S2
   lin, the head-end nodes S2 and S3 will automatically do the
   switching to S3-S4-S8-S2. This switching will be reported to the
   corresponding PNC (PNC1 in this example) and then MDSC. Other PNCs
   (PNC2 and PNC3 in this example) will not be aware of the failure and
   switching, nor do the nodes in Network domain 2 and 3.</t>

<t>When deploying ACTN functional components the securing of external
   interfaces and hardening of resource datastores, the protection of
   confidential information, and limiting the access of function,
   should all be carefully considered.  Section 9 of <xref target="RFC8453"/>
   highlights that implementations should consider encrypting data that

   at remote node. Further discussion on securing the interface between
   the MDSC and PNCs via the MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) is discussed in
   section 9.2 of <xref target="RFC8453"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG modules highlighted in this document are designed to be
   accessed via network configuration protocols such as NETCONF
   <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. When using NETCONF, utilizing a
   secure transport via Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/> is mandatory. If
   using RESTCONF, then secure transport via TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/> is
   mandatory. When using either NETCONF or RESTCONF, the use of Network

   restrict access to specific protocol operations and content.</t>

<section anchor="otn-security" title="OTN Security">

<t>Inherently OTN networks ensure privacy and security via hard

      <abstract>
	 <t>   There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN) context, where the topology information provided by
   a Traffic Engineering (TE) network provider may not be sufficient
   for its client to perform end-to-end path computation. In these
   cases the client would need to request the provider to calculate
   some (partial) feasible paths.

   This document defines a YANG data model for a Remote Procedure Call
   (RPC) to request path computation. This model complements the
   solution, defined in RFCXXXX, to configure a TE tunnel path in
   &quot;compute-only&quot; mode.

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC XXXX with the RFC number of
   draft-ietf-teas-yang-te once it has been published.

   Moreover this document describes some use cases where a path
   computation request, via YANG-based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or
   RESTCONF), can be needed.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity
   services to its client.  The topology and tunnel information in the
   transport layer has already been defined by generic Traffic-
   engineered models and technology-specific models (e.g., OTN, WSON).
   However, how the client signals are accessing to the network has not
   been described.  These information is necessary to both client and
   provider.

   This draft describes how the client signals are carried over
   transport network and defines YANG data models which are required
   during configuration procedure.  More specifically, several client
   signal (of transport network) models including ETH, STM-n, FC and so
   on, are defined in this draft.

<abstract><t>In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one or more networks from a source to a destination.  TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path.  TE information is usually only available within a network.  We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain.  An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System.</t><t>In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network.

This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.</t><t>This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement.

	 <t>   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the set of
   virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage
   large-scale multi-domain TE networks, so as to facilitate network
   programmability, automation, efficient resource sharing, and end-to-
   end virtual service aware connectivity and network function
   virtualization services.

   This document explains how the different types of YANG models
   defined in the Operations and Management Area and in the Routing
   Area are applicable to the ACTN framework. This document also shows
   how the ACTN architecture can be satisfied using classes of data
   model that have already been defined, and discusses the
   applicability of specific data models that are under development. It
   also highlights where new data models may need to be developed.

<section anchor="json-validation" title="Validating a JSON fragment against a YANG Model">

<t>The objective is to have a tool that allows validating whether a
   piece of JSON code embedded in an Internet-Draft is compliant with a
   YANG model without using a client/server.</t>

<section anchor="manipulation-of-json-fragments" title="Manipulation of JSON fragments">

<t>This section describes the various ways JSON fragments are used in
   the I-D processing and how to manage them.</t>

<t>Let’s call “folded-JSON” the JSON embedded in the I-D: it fits the
   72 chars width and it is acceptable for it to be invalid JSON.</t>

<t>We then define “unfolded-JSON” a valid JSON fragment having the same
   contents of the “folded-JSON “ without folding, i.e. limits on the
   text width. The folding/unfolding operation may be done according to
   <xref target="RFC8792"/>. The “unfolded-JSON” can be edited by the authors using
   JSON editors with the advantages of syntax validation and pretty-
   printing.</t>

<t>Both the “folded” and the “unfolded” JSON fragments can include
   comments having descriptive fields and directives we’ll describe
   later to facilitate the reader and enable some automatic processing.</t>

<t>The presence of comments in the “unfolded-JSON” fragment makes it an
   invalid JSON encoding of YANG data. Therefore we call “naked JSON”

   valid JSON but it is a valid JSON encoding of YANG data.</t>

<t>Our validation toolchain has been designed to take a JSON in any of
   the three formats and validate it automatically against a set of
   relevant YANG modules using available open-source tools. It can be
   found at: https://github.com/GianmarcoBruno/json-yang/</t>

<section anchor="comments-in-json-fragments" title="Comments in JSON fragments">

<t>We found useful to introduce two kinds of comments, both defined as
   key-value pairs where the key starts with “//”:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>free-form descriptive comments, e.g.”// COMMENT” : “refine this”
   to describe properties of JSON fragments.</t>
  <t>machine-usable directives e.g. “// <spanx style="strong">REFERENCES__DRAFTS</spanx>” : {
   “ietf-routing-types@2017-12-04”: “rfc8294”,} which can be used to
   automatically download from the network the relevant I-Ds or RFCs
   and extract from them the YANG models of interest. This is
   particularly useful to keep consistency when the drafting work is
   rapidly evolving.</t>

<section anchor="validation-of-json-fragments-dsdl-based-approach" title="Validation of JSON fragments: DSDL-based approach">

<t>The idea is to generate a JSON driver file (JTOX) from YANG, then
   use it to translate JSON to XML and validate it against the DSDL
   schemas, as shown in <xref target="fig-dsdl-approach"/>.</t>

<t>In order to allow the use of comments following the convention

   these comments will be automatically removed from the JSON-file that
   will be validate.</t>

<section anchor="validation-of-json-fragments-why-not-using-an-xsd-based-approach" title="Validation of JSON fragments: why not using an XSD-based approach">

<t>This approach has been analyzed and discarded because no longer
   supported by pyang.</t>

<t>The idea is to convert YANG to XSD, JSON to XML and validate it
   against the XSD, as shown in <xref target="fig-xsd-approach"/>:</t>

<t>The pyang support for the XSD output format was deprecated in 1.5
   and removed in 1.7.1. However pyang 1.7.1 is necessary to work with
   YANG 1.1 so the process shown in <xref target="fig-xsd-approach"/>
   will stop just at step (1).</t>
